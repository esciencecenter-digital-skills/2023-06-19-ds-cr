## üîß Exercises

### Tracking changes exercise

#### 1. Which command(s) below would save the changes of myfile.txt to my local Git repository?

1. `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
2. `git init myfile.txt`
   `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
3. `git add myfile.txt`
   `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
4. `git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"`


**Correct answer:** 3

#### 2. Committing Multiple Files
Remember that the staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

- Add some text to ``mars.txt`` noting your decision to consider Venus as a base
- Create a new file ``venus.txt`` with your initial thoughts about Venus as a base for you and your friends
- Add changes from both files to the staging area, and commit those changes.

#### 3. (optional) A new repository
1. Create a new Git repository on your computer called bio.
3. Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called me.txt.
4. Add the file to the staging area, and commit your changes.
5. Make a modification.
6. Display the differences between its updated state and its original state.


### Exercises for Ignoring Things
#### Ignoring Nested Files
Given a directory structure that looks like:
```
results/data
results/plots
```
How would you ignore only `results/plots` and not `results/data`?

#### (optional) Including Specific Files

How would you ignore all `.dat` files in your root directory except for `final.dat`? Hint: Find out what `!` (the exclamation point operator) does

## üß† Collaborative Notes

### Why version control
![Why version control](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)

* Version control is track changes on steroids.
* Version control is an unlimited undo.
* Version control also allows many people to work in parallel

### Setting up Git
Setup your name and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "My Name"
```

```bash
git config --global user.email "me@example.com"
```
For consistent line endings between different operating systems:
For Windows:
```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

For Mac or Linux or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

Change the default branch:
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

See your settings:
```bash
git config --list
```

Config help:
```bash
git config --help
```

General help:
```bash
git help
```

Change the default editor to e.g. nano:
```bash
git config --global core.editor nano
```


### Making a repository
Make a new directory:
```bash
mkdir planets
```

Go to that directory:
```bash
cd planets
```

Initialise a new git project:
```bash
git init
```

Check if it worked:
```bash
git status
```
or
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

See all files, but it doesn't show anything:
```bash
ls
```

See all files, including the *hidden* `.git` folder:
```bash
ls -a
```

Checkout a new branch `main`:
```bash
git checkout -b main
```

Make a subdirectory:
```bash
mkdir moons
cd moons
```

Create a nested git repository, **don't do this:**
```bash
git init
```
Git is not good at handling nested Git repositories. If you did this, you can delete the `.git` directory:
```bash
rm -rf .git
```
If you need nested repositories, check out [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

Go back to the `planets` folder:
```bash
cd ..
```

### Add content and track changes
Create and open a new file:
```bash
nano mars.txt
```
Enter the following text:
```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```

See if the text was written to the file correctly:
```bash
cat mars.txt
```

Check that you have one untracked file:
```bash
git status
```

Track the untracked file:
```bash
git add mars.txt
```

Commit that file:
```bash
git commit -m "start notes on Mars"
```

Now `git branch` will show the `main` branch, `git status` should say that there is nothing to commit.

See the logs:
```bash
git log
```

We will make more changes:
```bash
nano mars.txt
```
Add the following line
```
There are two moons on Mars, which might be a problem for Wolfman
```

Show the changes:
```bash
git diff
```

Running `git status` says there is a modified file. Add it again with
```bash
git add mars.txt
```

After staging files, you can see the changes only with
```bash
git diff --staged
```

Commit your changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
```

**TIP:** if you ever get stuck, run `git status` for helpful suggestions.

Edit the file again:
```bash
nano mars.txt
```
Change the word `two` to `2` and ddd the line
```
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```

Check out `git diff` again, you will see the two changed lines. Even though you only changed one word on the second line, Git will consider the full line to be changed. You can run `git diff --color-words` to see changes at a more granular level.

We will add the file again:
```bash
git add mars.txt
```

**Note on commit messages:** commit messages should not be too long, they should be short, descriptive and imperative and ideally under 50 characters long.

Now commit the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "add concerns regarding mummy"
```

With `git log` you can see the 3 commits. When the amount of commits grows, you can limit the output with e.g. `git log -2`. You can also get compressed output with `git log --oneline`.

**Note on undoing commits:** It is hard, but possible to undo commits, see e.g. https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/undo-last-commit for more info. However, commits pushed to remote repositories could have already been downloaded by others, so always be careful, especially when potentially committing sensitive data.


### Tracking Changes: Key Points

* Files can be stored in
    * working directory: the files you can see
    * staging area / index: files about to be committed
    * local repository: the permanent record
* git status  shows the status of a repository
* git add  puts files in the staging area
* git commit  saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository
* Write short, descriptive, and imperative commit messages


### Exploring History
In `git log --oneline`, you see the identifier `HEAD`, which points to the newest commit, along with the *commit hashes* and commit messages.

To see changes further in history, you can use e.g. `git diff HEAD~2` to see the difference between the current commit and two commits before.

You can also checkout a specific commit with e.g. `git checkout a7e88be`, replace the hash with a has from your history. This will switch over to `detached HEAD` state.

You can make changes in this state, so let's change the `mars.txt` file:
```bash
nano mars.txt
```
Add some text *above* the first line.

We add the changes again:
```bash
git add mars.txt
```

And commit:
```bash
git commit -m "write an introduction for mars"
```

Check `git status`. We will now switch to a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b marsintro
```
Let's check the history with `git status` and `git log`. Let's go back to main:
```bash
git checkout main
```
Now `git branch --all` should show two branches.

**Note on checkout:** The `git checkout` command does a lot of things, you can checkout branches but also individual commits. To switch between branches only, `git switch` is a cleaner option.

### Merging branches
We will now merge the `marsintro` branch into `main`:
```bash
git merge marsintro
```

If you merge two branches, there might be conflicts. As always, `git status` will show you what's happening. You should edit the conflicted files to resolve the conflicts. A conflict might look like the following example:
```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
<<<<<<< HEAD
We added a different line in the other copy
=======
This line added to Wolfman's copy
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
```

The `<<<<<<< HEAD` tag shows your changes, the `=======` is a separator between the conflicted changes and `>>>>>>>` marks the end of the conflicted changes.


### Ignoring files
The `.gitignore` file is a text file in which you can put files that you don't want Git to track.

Create one with
```bash
touch .gitignore
```
and open it for editing:
```bash
nano .gitignore
```
A good use case is to ignore binary files, so for example add `*.docx` as an entry. This means that Git will ignore all files with a name that ends with `.docx`. You can also add folders, e.g. `/data` or specific files like `saturn.txt`.

If you did this, create two files:
```bash
touch saturn.txt
touch pluto.txt
```
If you run `git status`, you will see that `saturn.txt` is not listed at all, even though you did not even start tracking the `.gitignore` file itself. It is still a good idea to track it though:
```bash
git add .gitignore
git add pluto.txt
git commit -m "add .gitignore and pluto.txt"
```

You can keep tracking specific files or folders that were excluded previously with the exclamation operator (`!`). Just add it at the start of the line of the file or folder you want to track, e.g. `!example.txt`

The following repository lists useful `.gitignore` configurations for common programming setups: https://github.com/github/gitignore


### Interactive commits
You can interactively choose what parts of a file to commit with `git add --patch` or `git add -p`. See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#_interactive_mode for more information


### Check your SSH keypair
The follwing command will check if your SSH keypair is working.
```bash
ssh git@github.com
```
It should say something like
```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed
```
